# AutoFolder-Creator
This project was created in order to help my school's Yearbook Club. They needed a more efficient way to organize the creation of folders in google drive to store photos of students to be placed into the yearbook. Instead of manually creating a folder for 400+ Students each year, just paste the names of the students into the excel spreadsheet and run the program for the folders to automatically be created. 


Objective:
Automatically create a set of folders in GOOGLE DRIVE by using the cells in Excel
